Welcome to my Adobe I/O Application!

## Setup

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it with credentials for your own
  App Builder workspace, Firefly Services project, and AEM environment. The
  extension does not use a shared AEM environment.
- Keep `.env` local. It is ignored by Git.

## Local Dev

- `aio app run` to start your local Dev server
- App will run on `localhost:9080` by default

By default the UI will be served locally but actions will be deployed and served from Adobe I/O Runtime. To run your actions locally use the `aio app dev` option.

For more information on the difference between `aio app run` and `aio app dev`, see [here](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/guides/development/#aio-app-dev-vs-aio-app-run)

## Test & Coverage

- Run `aio app test` to run unit tests for ui and actions
- Run `aio app test --e2e` to run e2e tests

## Deploy & Cleanup

- `aio app deploy` to build and deploy all actions on Runtime and static files to CDN
- `aio app undeploy` to undeploy the app

## Config

### `.env`

You can generate the App Builder workspace values using `aio app use`.
Start from `aem-extension/.env.example` for the full Runtime, Firefly, and AEM
configuration.

```bash
# This file must **not** be committed to source control

## please provide your Adobe I/O Runtime credentials
# AIO_RUNTIME_AUTH=
# AIO_RUNTIME_NAMESPACE=
```

The Runtime action reads `AEM_SC_JSON` (preferred durable Service Credential)
and the Firefly values at deploy time. Replace every
environment-specific value with one from your own org; do not copy another
team member's `.env`.

When Assets View supplies the current author URL in its resource or host
metadata, the extension passes that URL with the job and uses it for the
request. `AEM_AUTHOR_URL` is optional and remains available as a fallback for
hosts that do not expose that metadata (and for local tests), so one deployment
can work across environments without embedding an environment ID.

### `app.config.yaml`

- Main configuration file that defines an application's implementation. 
- More information on this file, application configuration, and extension configuration 
  can be found [here](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/guides/configuration/#appconfigyaml)

#### Action Dependencies

- You have two options to resolve your actions' dependencies:

  1. **Packaged action file**: Add your action's dependencies to the root
   `package.json` and install them using `npm install`. Then set the `function`
   field in `app.config.yaml` to point to the **entry file** of your action
   folder. We will use `webpack` to package your code and dependencies into a
   single minified js file. The action will then be deployed as a single file.
   Use this method if you want to reduce the size of your actions.

  2. **Zipped action folder**: In the folder containing the action code add a
     `package.json` with the action's dependencies. Then set the `function`
     field in `app.config.yaml` to point to the **folder** of that action. We will
     install the required dependencies within that directory and zip the folder
     before deploying it as a zipped action. Use this method if you want to keep
     your action's dependencies separated.

## Debugging in VS Code

While running your local server (`aio app dev`), both UI and actions can be debugged. To do so follow the instructions [here](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/guides/development/#debugging)

## Typescript support for UI

To use typescript use `.tsx` extension for react components and add a `tsconfig.json` 
and make sure you have the below config added
```
 {
  "compilerOptions": {
      "jsx": "react"
    }
  } 
```
